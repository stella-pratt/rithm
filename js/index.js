A full ten years and billions of streams later, Hozier still calls Wicklow home. While his music takes him all over the world, it is Ireland and its people and places, the weather and landscape; where a stream is still something that runs down at the bottom of the garden, that calls him back to where he feels he naturally belongs. The last decade has brought both public and critical acclaim. Multi-platinum album sales, number one records on both sides of the Atlantic, multiple awards including a Grammy-nomination, film and video game soundtracks and countless sold-out live shows all over the world.

Of the album, Billboard raved, “Anyone familiar with Joji’s dulcet tones and emotionally revealing lyricism could have predicted that he’d become a solo star.” AllMusic also said of the album, which clocks in at just under 25 minutes, “is the perfect length to wallow in sadness before wiping off the tears and carrying on. It's not the happiest of experiences, but it is his most mature and relatable statement to date.” SMITHEREENS follows his album Nectar, executive produced and arranged by Joji, which bowed out at #3 on the Billboard 200 album chart."],

    mac: ["MAC DEMARCO", "Mac DeMarco's music is inextricably linked to his warmly weird personality, with his distinctive songwriting style and warped production sound mirroring his off-kilter charm and apparent laid-back look on life. While the Canadian artist's image projects a low-key slacker prone to occasional antics and never taking anything too seriously, his breezy songs ironically often hide mature themes of aging, commitment, and morals under layers of chorus and reverb. Early releases on Captured Tracks and endless touring enlarged DeMarco's fan base, and the 2014 album Salad Days pushed his strange mix of slacker pop, jazz, '70s soft rock, and glam into the vanguard realm, performing well commercially and changing the shape of what was happening in indie rock at the time. Subsequent moves to New York and Los Angeles each yielded quality releases on which the multi-instrumentalist DeMarco became known for playing and recording all of the parts himself. His 2017 album This Old Dog explored themes of getting older, this time with upgraded production, a trend that continued on 2019's Here Comes the Cowboy, which he released on his own imprint. In 2023, DeMarco released both the entirely instrumental album Five Easy Hot Dogs and One Wayne G, a collection of 199 pieces of music that clocked in at a run time of close to nine hours."],

    men: ["MEN I TRUST", "The story of Men I Trust’s rise to indie fame is a bit more abnormal than most. The group initially started without their lead singer. In 2014 keyboardist Dragos Chiriac and bassist-guitarist Jessy Caron, both Quebec music graduates and high school friends reunited after college and came together to form a duo named Men I Trust. Their music was heavily inspired by the electronic movement of the 2000s. If you take for example a song from their self titled 2014 debut like Endless Strive and compare it to their most recent output you immediately hear the difference in their approach to production. The programmed robotic electronic drums alongside these boisterous synthesizers give you a closer look into how the duo looked at song creation. The basics where all there, the dance-inducing, funkiness and soothe demeanor coupled with great vocal performances by frequent guest collaborators offered a range of different song types. Sometime between June of that year and March of the next, Emma was asked to join the band as their official and full-time singer.

The Smiths signed to the independent label Rough Trade Records in 1983 and released their first album, The Smiths, in 1984. Their focus on a guitar, bass and drum sound, fusing 1960s rock and post-punk, was a rejection of the synth-pop sound predominant at the time. Several Smiths singles reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, and all their studio albums reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, including the number-one album Meat Is Murder (1985). They achieved mainstream success in Europe with The Queen Is Dead (1986) and Strangeways, Here We Come (1987), which both entered the top 20 of the European Albums Chart.[6] In early 1986, the band became a five-piece with the addition of guitarist Craig Gannon, though he departed by the end of that year, returning the band to its original four-piece line-up."],
